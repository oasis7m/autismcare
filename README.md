# 🏷️ Project name

**Rehabilitation games for autistic children**

# 📖 Introduction

This is an intelligent interactive platform dedicated to the support, companionship and rehabilitation training of children with autism, providing:

✨ Image recognition  
✨ Emotionally friendly UI
✨ Intelligent communication companion assistant
✨ Rehabilitation training game  
✨ A caring and low-pressure user experience
✨ Professional analysis report

This website is specifically designed for children with autism as the main group, targeting autism rehabilitation institutions, individual families, people with autism, etc. It provides functions such as daily training, rehabilitation, social skills training, emotional companionship, and communication companionship for people with autism.

**Why do we want to create this website?**

In this world, there is such a group of children
The world they see is somewhat different from ours.
Sometimes, they are lost in their own little universes.
Sometimes, they long to be understood but don't know how to express it.

We hope to build a bridge for them.
Make communication more natural, training easier and companionship warmer.

So, we developed a care website for children with autism———
An intelligent platform integrating training, recognition and emotional support.

This is not merely a technological attempt,
it is also a practice of understanding and love.

# Background

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects children's social communication, behavioral patterns and perception methods. According to data from the Global Health Organization, the number of children with autism is increasing year by year. The global average incidence rate is approximately 1% to 2%. Many of these children have missed the best time for early intervention due to delayed diagnosis, uneven distribution of intervention resources, or insufficient family awareness.

**In real life, children with autism and their families are confronted with multiple predicaments:**

🧩 Long diagnostic cycle: Professional assessment requires queuing for months or even longer, resulting in delayed intervention

🧠 Cognitive differences are hard to detect: mild autism or subclinical symptoms are often overlooked

🏫 imbalance of educational and rehabilitation resources: quality institutions are concentrated in big cities, and most families have difficulty obtaining continuous support

👨‍👩‍👧 parents lack guidance: Many parents do not know how to interact with their children, assess their development or improve the effectiveness of training

Meanwhile, with the development of artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision and behavioral analysis models, we have the opportunity to make technology truly serve special groups, making the early screening, assessment and rehabilitation of children with autism earlier, faster, more accurate and more accessible.

In light of such realistic predicaments and technological opportunities, this project came into being.

# 🔭 Future Improvement

- Add more advanced functions such as emotion recognition, posture analysis, and behavior trend prediction.

- Introduce user behavior log analysis to provide more personalized feedback.

- Train larger-scale datasets to enhance recognition robustness.

- Add third-party API interfaces to support access from external platforms.

- Establish an account system, encrypt data privacy, and implement HIPAA coarse-grained compliance.

- It will be piloted in hospitals, schools and rehabilitation centers.
